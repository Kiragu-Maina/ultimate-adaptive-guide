# Checklist: AI-Powered Adaptive Learning Mentor (For Students and Underprivileged Communities)

## 1. Define Project Scope
- [ ] Identify the specific needs of students and underprivileged communities:
  - For students: Focus on school subjects, exam preparation, and skill-building.
  - For underprivileged communities: Ensure accessibility and affordability.
- [ ] Define the learning domains or subjects to focus on (e.g., math, science, language learning).
- [ ] Determine the desired features (e.g., quizzes, progress tracking, gamification, multilingual support).

## 2. Design System Architecture
- [ ] Define the roles of the three agents:
  - Knowledge Assessor Agent
  - Content Personalizer Agent
  - Motivation and Feedback Agent
- [ ] Choose LangGraph as the orchestration framework.
- [ ] Plan the data flow between agents and tools.

## 3. Select Tools and Technologies
- [ ] Use OpenRouter's free models for NLP tasks (e.g., text understanding, response generation).
- [ ] Implement a lightweight recommendation system for personalized content.
- [ ] Integrate simple gamification tools (e.g., badges, rewards).
- [ ] Use open-source data visualization libraries for progress tracking (e.g., Matplotlib, Chart.js).

## 4. Implement Agents
### Knowledge Assessor Agent
- [ ] Develop a module to create and administer quizzes tailored to the curriculum.
- [ ] Implement algorithms to evaluate learner performance.
- [ ] Identify gaps in knowledge based on quiz results.

### Content Personalizer Agent
- [ ] Build a content curation system to fetch and organize learning materials.
- [ ] Implement dynamic difficulty adjustment based on learner progress.
- [ ] Integrate multimedia content (e.g., videos, simulations).
- [ ] Ensure content is accessible in multiple languages and formats.

### Motivation and Feedback Agent
- [ ] Develop a module to provide real-time feedback and encouragement.
- [ ] Use sentiment analysis (via OpenRouter models) to detect frustration or disengagement.
- [ ] Implement gamification elements to maintain engagement.
- [ ] Include culturally relevant motivational content for underprivileged communities.

## 5. Integrate Orchestration Framework
- [ ] Set up LangGraph as the orchestration framework.
- [ ] Define workflows for agent collaboration.
- [ ] Test the coordination between agents.

## 6. Test and Iterate
- [ ] Conduct user testing with students and underprivileged communities.
- [ ] Refine the system based on user feedback.
- [ ] Test edge cases and ensure robustness.

## 7. Deploy the System
- [ ] Set up hosting for the application (e.g., free-tier cloud services like Heroku, Render).
- [ ] Ensure scalability to handle multiple users.
- [ ] Monitor system performance and fix any issues.

## 8. Maintain and Improve
- [ ] Regularly update learning content to align with curricula and user needs.
- [ ] Monitor user engagement and satisfaction.
- [ ] Add new features based on user needs and feedback.
- [ ] Partner with local organizations to expand reach and impact.
