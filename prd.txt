Project Objectives
In this project, you'll design and implement a multi-agent system that demonstrates your mastery of the core Module 2 concepts:

Tool Integration: Show how agents can extend their capabilities through built-in and custom tools
Multi-Agent Collaboration: Design agents with distinct roles that communicate and coordinate effectively
Agent Orchestration: Use an orchestration framework (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, or similar) for workflow management
What You‚Äôll Build üõ†Ô∏è
You'll build a multi-agent system that incorporates the key learning objectives from Module 2. Your system must include:

Required Components:
1. Multi-Agent System (minimum 3 agents)

At least 3 agents with distinct roles working together
Clear communication or coordination between agents
Use an orchestration framework (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, or similar)
2. Tool Integration

Your system should integrate at least 3 different tools
Tools can be built-in (LangChain tools) or custom implementations
Tools should extend capabilities beyond basic LLM responses (e.g., web search, math calculations, file processing, API calls, etc.)
